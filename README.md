# Java Date Class Implementation

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive `Date` class in Java that provides functionality for:
- Creating and validating date objects
- Updating date values
- Determining the day of the week for a date
- Calculating the difference between dates
- Formatting dates for display
- Sorting dates in chronological order

The implementation handles leap years correctly and provides robust error checking for invalid dates.

## Features
- **Date Validation**: Ensures that dates are valid, including leap year handling for February 29th
- **Day of Week Calculation**: Determines which day of the week a date falls on
- **Date Comparison**: Compares dates and calculates the number of days between two dates
- **Sorting Support**: Implements the `Comparable` interface to enable sorting of dates
- **Elegant Formatting**: Provides methods to display dates in a human-readable format

## Class Structure
1. **Date.java**: The main `Date` class that implements all required functionality
2. **Main.java**: A demonstration program showing how to use the `Date` class

## Compilation and Execution Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Compiling the Project
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-date-class.git
cd java-date-class

# Compile the Java files
javac Date.java Main.java
```

### Running the Program
```bash
java Main
```

## Implementation Details

### Date Validation
The `isValidDate()` method validates dates by checking:
- Year is positive
- Month is between 1 and 12
- Day is valid for the given month, accounting for leap years

### Leap Year Calculation
A year is a leap year if:
- It is divisible by 4 but not by 100, OR
- It is divisible by 400

### Date Comparison
The `compareTo()` method compares dates by:
1. First comparing years
2. If years are equal, comparing months
3. If months are also equal, comparing days

## Additional Notes and Challenges

### Key Challenges
1. **Leap Year Handling**: Correctly implementing the leap year logic for February 29th validation
2. **Date Calculation**: Efficiently calculating the difference between dates in days
3. **Error Handling**: Providing meaningful error messages for invalid date inputs

### Possible Enhancements
1. Add support for different date formats
2. Implement methods for date arithmetic (add/subtract days/months/years)
3. Add timezone support
4. Support for different calendar systems (Julian, Islamic, etc.)
